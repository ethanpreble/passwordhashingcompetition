Catena
======
Catena is a memory-consuming password scrambler that excellently
thwarts massively parallel attacks on cheap memory-constrained
hardware, such as recent graphical processing units (GPUs).
Furthermore, Catena is resistance against cache-timing attacks, since
its memory-access pattern is password-independent.

* Catena-Dragonfly (formerly known as Catena-BRG)
* Catena-Butterfly (formerly known as Catena-DBG)

Tweaks
-------
A tweak that replaces the reduced hash function H' with the full hash function, 
can be enabled by appending FULLHASH=1 to the make invocation. Like this:

    make all FULLHASH=1

Dependencies
